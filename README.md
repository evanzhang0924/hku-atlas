# Introduction
>The Atlas is a bipedal humanoid robot primarily developed by the American robotics company Boston Dynamics, with funding and oversight from the United States Defense Advanced Research Project Agency(DARPA).

>We have the Atlas version 4 in the team HKU, and this was programmed by six different teams. They will compete in the DARPA Robotics Challenge to test the robot's ability to perform various tasks, including getting in and out of a vehicle and driving it, opening a door, and using a power tool. A variety of other robots will also compete. The contest was inspired by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and carries a USD 2 million prize for the winning team.

# Project Aim
>I aim to develop the Atlas catching a flying ball, in this way, we can see more information about how to control this humanoid robot and left the learning material for the next students.

>Therefore, I have several problems to solve, as following:  
>1. The Atlas has to identity the flying ball in the air and predicts the ball tracking in a quite short time.  
>2. After identitying the trajectory, the Atlas needs to react so quickly that it can move its hand(haven't determine which arm) to the intersection point.  
>3. Detecting the ball untill it falls down into the hand, how to judge when is the suitable time to fold the fingers.

# Curent Progress
>Working on the ROS and DRCSIM tutorials...
